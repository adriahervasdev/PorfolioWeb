### Description

CHNALD is an augmented reality (AR) reconstruction of the facilities at the Aristide Le Dantec National Hospital Center. The application allows users to interact with various buildings, providing additional information through audio and images to offer a more immersive experience.

### Role

- **Unreal Engine Programmer**: As the sole programmer on the project, I handled all aspects related to programming and publishing the application. I collaborated closely with the art department to ensure the best possible outcome.

### Tools and Technologies

- Unreal Engine 5.0
- C++
- AR
- Android
- iOS
- ARKit / ARCore
- Git

### Challenges and Achievements

- Successful publication of the application on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
- Integration and optimization of elements from the previously developed virtual reality project ([CHNALD VR](https://adriahervas.com/projects/es/chnald)) into the augmented reality (AR) platform, ensuring optimal performance on mobile devices.
