As a web developer, I collaborated in implementing new functionalities and enhancements for the DialApplet helpdesk software, which is integrated with messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram. This system managed chats via websockets in C++ and used PostgreSQL to store user information.

In addition to developing new features, I assisted in maintaining the application, both on the frontend and backend. This included bug resolution, performance optimization, and ensuring the software operated efficiently and smoothly.
