As a C++ Unreal Engine developer, I helped maintain code, troubleshoot issues, and encapsulate functionalities into plugins for code reuse across different projects.

Additionally, I collaborated in the development of various virtual reality applications focused on Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, and HTC Vive XR Elite, covering both single-player and multiplayer experiences.

I developed augmented reality applications for Android and iOS.

I contributed to the integration of the necessary pipeline for deploying to Oculus using Git, GitHub, and AWS.

I worked on projects following the agile Kanban methodology.
